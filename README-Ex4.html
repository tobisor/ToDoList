    This is the Final Project by Omer Inbar and Or Tobis.<br>
    The app is also implemented via Heroku : <a href="https://intense-beach-11390.herokuapp.com/login">app-in-Heroku</a><br>
    since not every device have the same browser, we recommend to use chrome over android. <br>

    <ul>
        <li>the goal behind the UI was to create a LOGIN page,different REGISTER page,<br> another page to control conveniently all Lists APIs, and another one to look at the shared lists.</li>
        <li>The first UI page , is the login page which has a link to the registration pags</li>
        <li>after registration/login you will be trasfered to the lists' page (/item).</li>

    </ul>

    Thank you, we had a good one!
